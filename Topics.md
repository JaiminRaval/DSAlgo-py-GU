## Learning Tips for Each Week:

### ðŸ“š Study Structure (Recommended 8-10 hours/week):
- **Day 1-2:** Learn concepts, watch tutorials, read materials
- **Day 3-4:** Implement data structures/algorithms from scratch
- **Day 5-6:** Solve practice problems (start easy, progress to medium)
- **Day 7:** Work on the fun project, review, and prepare for next week

### ðŸŽ¯ Practice Resources:
- **Easy Problems:** Focus on understanding and implementation
- **Medium Problems:** Apply concepts in various scenarios
- **Hard Problems:** Only 1-2 per week, focus on crucial patterns


### ðŸš€ Progression Philosophy:
- **Weeks 1-4:** Build solid foundations
- **Weeks 5-8:** Core data structures mastery
- **Weeks 9-12:** Advanced concepts and integration

This schedule balances theory with practical implementation, ensuring you understand both the "what" and "why" of each concept while building real programming skills!

Happy Coding Folks!
